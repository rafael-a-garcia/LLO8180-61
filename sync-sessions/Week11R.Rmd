This week we will learn how to compute and analyze correlations
First set your working directory

Let's look at the phd data from async
Let's import the data
```{r}
phd_data <- read.table("phd.txt", header=TRUE, sep="\t")
phd_data #print it
```

Now we will make a scatterplot (IV on x-axis; DV on y-axis)
```{r}
plot(phd_data$Time, phd_data$Pubs, 
     main="Scatterplot of Time & Publications",
     xlab="Time Since PhD Grad (in years)", 
     ylab="Publications", pch=12)
```

We can use R to compute the Pearson Correlation and obtain other values for the hypothesis test
```{r}
cor.test(phd_data$Time, phd_data$Pubs)
```

Calculate effect size (R^2)
```{r}
0.6566546^2
```
